This repo can be used to scaffold a Simple TALL (Tailwind CSS, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire) package that could act as 
an add-on dash to your project (Think Nova, Telescope or Horizon).
Follow these steps to get started:

1. Press the "Use template" button at the top of this repo to create a new repo with the contents of this skeleton
2. Run "php ./configure.php" to run a script that will replace all placeholders throughout all the files
3. Remove this block of text.
4. Have fun creating your package.
5. If you need help creating a package, consider picking up our <a href="https://laravelpackage.training">Laravel Package Training</a> video course.

## Support us

The template here is made by YLS Ideas but most of the difficult work came from Spatie's Laravel package template.
Please consider supporting Spatie as they made so many useful things for the community.

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require :vendor_slug/:package_slug
```

You can install :package_name using the built in artisan command:

```bash
php artisan skeleton:install
```

Once installed you may enable :package_name by setting the env

```dotenv
SKELETON_DOMAIN=true
```

You may also configure the security of :package_name by editing the SkeletonServiceProvider
installed in your Providers folder.

```php
protected function gate(): void
{
    Gate::define('viewSkeleton', function ($user) {
        return true;
    });
}
```
